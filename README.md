# CozyNestAR
CozyNest is a Markerless Augmented Reality (AR) platform that utilizes ground plane detection, allowing virtual objects to be seamlessly integrated into real-world environments. Developed using Unity with Vuforia as the SDK, this immersive mobile application offers users a transformative interior design experience. Figure 3 shows CozyNest's main menu, featuring six buttons enabling users to access catalogs for various categories: favorites, sofas/chairs, tables, storage, beds, and decor. Each catalog showcases multiple furniture items with shopping cart and AR buttons. Pressing the AR button switches the app to AR mode. Additionally, users can tap the shopping cart button, directing them to an integrated e-commerce platform offering similar products.
